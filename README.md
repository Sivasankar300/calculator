## **A Calculator Project** made for the The Odin Project's Full-Stack WebDev course's applied learning method. *(Still working on this)*

**Link to The Odin Project course**: https://www.theodinproject.com/

### What this Project is for:
This project is focused on deepening one's knowledge of DOM, Eventlisteners, Mouse and Keyboard events.
As well as letting the students figure out and learn How to store, Process and Display the values for the Calculator to function.

**Live Preview:** https://sivasankarh.github.io/calculator/

### What I have learnt from it:
 I have achieved the solution to the above problem by utilising advanced Array functions such as "push" and textContent instead of innerHTML to display the values as innerHTML is prone to cross-site scripting attacks.

### It's functions:
- Perform all forms of Arithmatic calculations (Add,Subtract,Multipy,Divide)
- Has keyboard functionality
- Results with longer integers are rounded to the nearest 2 decimals
  
### Functionality in works:
- Decimal point to perform calculation on floating point numbers
- Backscape to remove numbers one at a time
- Better CSS
- Clean up the commit log as there are some mistakes.

- Added Keyboard support for extra credits for now.
